Investigating Walmart sales across 45 different Walmart stores. 
This dataset came from Kaggle.com which includes 6,435 observations following the popular general merchandise store Walmart. 
The data was collected from February 5, 2010 to October 26, 2012. 
Variables include the store number, date of the sales week, weekly sales, holiday, temperature, fuel price, consumer price index(CPI), and unemployment rate. 
Holidays only included the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. 
During our analysis, we found that extremely high sales were made from the weeks of Thanksgiving to Christmas. 
Since Walmart has such a large chain, we wanted to know what factors contributed to weekly sales the most. 

This project was done by myself and Nicole Pham, a fellow classmate in the mathematics and statistics department at California State University, Long Beach. 
The attached zip file includes: our powerpoint presentation, the code in R, the knitted html file, and the descriptive report of the project.
